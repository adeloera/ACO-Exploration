This R markdown file creates sample code for the visualizations that will form the backbone of the exploration in the shiny application. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#As always, I begin by loading in the libraries I will use throughout the project. 

library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)

#Next I read in the data I will use throughout the project. 

aco_master <- read_rds("ACO_exploration/aco_master_file.rds")

county_master <- read_rds("ACO_exploration/county_master_file.rds")

```
